## About >
Personal Nvidia GPU &amp; Creative SoundBlaster Audio QuickTool with built-in real-time monitoring


## Framework & library dependencies >
MahApps.Metro > https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro  
LibreHardwareMonitorLib > https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor


## Notes >
 Changing GPU Profiles will need the 'MSI-Afterburner' application to be installed (https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/msi-afterburner-beta-download.html) (doesn't need to be running. MiToolz will send the selected profile to MSI-Afterburner and then close it immediately)


## Planned >
1. Implement universal audio equalizer to remove reliance of proprietary audio software ie, Creative SoundBlaster control panel etc
2. ~~Add ability to switch audio output devices from within MiToolz itself~~  -- Completed
3. Add option (service) for changing the Windows Timer Resolution setting, ie 1ms or 0.5ms etc
