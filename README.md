## About >
Personal Nvidia GPU &amp; Creative SoundBlaster Audio QuickTool with built-in real-time monitoring


## Framework & library dependencies >
MahApps.Metro > https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro  
LibreHardwareMonitorLib > https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor
NAudio > https://github.com/naudio/NAudio
NirCmd > https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html


## Notes >
 Changing GPU Profiles will need the 'MSI-Afterburner' application to be installed (https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/msi-afterburner-beta-download.html) (doesn't need to be running. MiToolz will send the selected profile to MSI-Afterburner and then close it immediately)


## Planned >
1. ~~Add ability to switch audio output devices from within MiToolz itself~~  >> Completed.
2. Implement universal audio equalizer to remove reliance of proprietary audio software ie, Creative SoundBlaster control panel etc
3. Add option (service) for changing the Windows Timer Resolution setting, ie 1ms or 0.5ms etc
